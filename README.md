## What I used?

I used Vanilla Javascript for this project and Bootstrap.

## How validation works?

This validator is built with help of OOP. It has main config file where configuration of validation is established. This config file is custom, and can be edited for the purpose of project. Functionality is build in class of Validator. 

### How do I get errors?

Errors are generated by for loop that runs through all fields, and creates empty array for each of them. When the error is established, array is filled with that error. Error has name and is created for only field where mistake is made.

## Email validation?

I validated email using email regex that can be found online.
```javascript
if (/^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*(\.\w{2,3})+$/.test(email)){
  return (true);
  }
  return (false);
}
```
